"the app itself is great! a lot of great content to read and learn from other people knowledge and experiences. that said, the negative side is that you can only get unlimited access paying with dolar. i'd be very thankful (and i know that a lot of others too) if medium team considered to adjust the price of unlimited access to the specific country currency. i'm from brazil, so it would be great to have a fair price in brazilian real. us$ 5 can be too much for some people in some countries.",SUBSCRIPTION
"the app won't open except for 1 or 2 basic functions. you can't even contact support if you have the app downloaded. this can be important because the staff doesn't respond to reports of abuse of its platform by people who post ad hominem attacks on your stories. not surprising they then try to use the app you download to block contacting them, the insulters probably work for medium. add to that they rig their algorithm to ensure only certain perspectives are seen by others .",INTERFACE

"this review is only taking into account the medium mobile application - users leaving negative reviews because they are unhappy about a paywall shouldn't be leaving reviews here, since this is a company standard, not just app-related. ****************************************************************** i have only started using medium as a writing outlet this month (nov '21). i routinely write remotely, when away from my desktop, so i downloaded the app. it wasn't long before i saw the application lacked seemingly basic features, which prompted me to write to medium customer service to inquire into those features that would be helpful, yet are missing. ****************************************************************** firstly, i tried to remove line breaks in between paragraphs, with a desire to turn two into one. i placed my cursor at the lead of the second paragraph, clicked backspace and, nothing. removing a line break doesn't appear to be an option in the mobile app. ****************************************************************** nextly, as i was attempting to remove the line breaks, i inadvertently added the 3 dots (add-a-section). i tried to remove them, but this doesn't appear to be an option in the mobile app. ****************************************************************** lastly, i tried selecting all text in my story draft, but that only selects one paragraph at a time, telling me once again, this doesn't appear to be an option in the mobile app. ****************************************************************** i received a response from support the next day, and they're response was ""unfortunately, the app editor is more limited than the desktop editor and some of the things you are trying to achieve are not currently possible. i've shared your feedback with the responsible team so they can take it into account for future developments."" ****************************************************************** i am certainly not a professional developer (i'm barely a novice), but this app launched for android in 2015, which means for 6+ years these features have been missing - i can't imagine these are going to be integrated any time soon. ****************************************************************** amongst the many hundreds of reviews ytd 2021, medium has responded to a total of seven (7), which is not uncommon for app developers, but i like to see companies doing this more often than not because it tells me they care about their application and its improvement. ****************************************************************** for reference purposes: i am using samsung galaxy s10+, running android 11",INTERFACE

i appreciate good writing and i know there is a lot of excellent content on medium. i also approve of their business model of providing some free content and putting other content behind a paywall in order to pay writers. and i am considering becoming a paying member. however - apparently you only get 1 free paywalled article per month as a none member. and everything this app recommends for me to read is paywalled - at least as far as i can tell by clicking one article after another and getting told i have to pay to read it. if the point is to provide some free reading to encourage people to pay to support good writing the experience needs to be much less frustrating. make sure some free content appears in the feed and label articles as free or paid so potential readers don't have the endless frustration of clicking and being turned away. i'm sure many folks just delete the app after a few fruitless clicks. other than that the app works fine. just extremely frustrating.,SUBSCRIPTION

i just miss color texts on medium,INTERFACE
this is aweful. beyond words useless. i had been trying to choose a blogging platform and several reviews on seemed to say medium was what i needed. i tried several times to create a blog. that doesn't actually seem to be the focus here they just want to cram their content down your throat. i had to follow a link from a third party website to start a blog. you must upload a photo to continue but when i clicked i got an upload failed message. i had not selected a photo yet.,INTERFACE

decent app. the limit on free articles is too low and price point annoys me to the point that i'm not purchasing it out of spite.,SUBSCRIPTION
not worth the money. the article seems to be not the most recent one but randomly generated around the past time. i really like the ui but that alone cant justify the fact that the basic article needs to be paid. about 40 dollar per year for lame article that is not always based on fact but just merely an opinion. and you can always read any article for free but from the website by right clicking the article and open in incognito mode. you will be reading for free without any page block.

i absolutely did not download this and i don't know why it's on my phone. i'm not technology ignorant like many who accidentally download something. i'm usually the one giving my elderly relatives the rundown on not clicking on things and trying to clean their phones out after they have so the fact is this is on my phone really irritates me,INTERFACE

this application and business model is silly. i get punished for trying to use the application by getting to read a maximum of five articles a month. the quality of the articles can be whatever it still counts towards the limit. yet there's a nice little workaround when you go to incognito mode and bypass any limits. it's ironic that the application itself is pushing me away from it. my 2 cents: have premium articles that count towards the limit and the rest is free.,SUBSCRIPTION

"the app is very well designed, and stories can be solid. but while i understand the need to monetize journalism, the problem, medium content can hardly be called that. it's more of an aggregated array of blogs. some good, some not so. that begs the question, is $50/year good value for what you get? personally i don't think so. while medium claims they share some profits with top writers, there is no official data on how much they collect vs what they share. this makes me think that they are mostly collecting subscription cash for next to nothing, for themselves while contributing no content of their own. quality app/web development has costs, but surely it can be subsided with ads. personally, i'd be willing to pay $20-25 per year for ad free content that's well presented, but $50 is just too steep for me.",SUBSCRIPTION

that an article simply won't load. instead it just snaps back to the 
article list without an error message whatsoever even when having a stable 
connection. reloading the app helps sometimes - not always - in which case 
i have to open the article in the browser instead, which works just fine. 
if you are offline or have a bad connection you are playing roulette when 
clicking on an article. same issue there, albeit seemingly unrelated. 
handling bad connections / offline is usually something where native apps 
outperform non-pwas. not in this case though. this of the rare cases where 
the native app xp is so bad that i prefer to use the browser version 
instead.",INTERFACE

an app in the first place. for the service: most of the writing is very 
clearly written by amateurs. despite the company's best efforts the 
platform is awash with very weak self-help garbage and clickbait nonsense. 
like twitter it demands some work from new users to iterate through people 
to follow and be liberal about blocking writers who regularly post garbage 
(literally all of the top writers). unlike twitter you do not get a well if 
discourse and interesting ideas for your trouble. you get a lot of self 
promotion, product launches and vc announcements. if that's what you want

would like better options for new writers to help readers get more engaged... other than that i love it... i've been hooked ever since... like the content i'd normally search for is delivered to me on a silver platter... very intuitive app!,USER_EXPERIENCE
"the app is a good daytime reader. no ""night mode"" available which is when i do most of my reading means i have to look up articles on the web, send them to instapaper and then read them there, a lot more comfortably on a dark background with adjustabke margins and line spacing. but then if i want to highlight something i want associated with my account or share, quote or comments on it with the author, i have to do the reverse. it's inconvenient enough to encourage me to write this review. also, scrolling often llags more frequently  than reading  the same article  on the web, which leads me to think they are  behavior-mining reading speed or scrolling habits for engagement measurement. thars a bit more intrusive than i'm comfortable with. the app is good for   your own writing and to publish later. although i'd you want to make sure your published articles look as you'd expect both on mobile and the web, i'd recommend to always check your draft on the desktop version before publishing. sometimes the image sizing is not quite consistent with the published version. it's not impossible to do, though, telegra.ph does, but it doesn't have the audience that medium does. so for the moment network effects dictate that medium it is, for publishing to a wider audience and article discovery. try telegram+telegra.ph though. combining telegram's massive channels with telegra.ph may evolve into a medium killer, if they put their minds to it or if medium keeps ignoring simple but basic reader features like ""night mode"" and adjustable margins and line spacing",INTERFACE

"i'd give 3 stars for the product as it exists today -- a 4th star for ambition/trajectory. these days, medium is leaning in a smart direction to balance the goal of democratizing publishing and ensuring that readers get tossed high-quality content. and of course, the app is gorgeous. now for my gripes: the *clap* function is dumb bc ppl can use it any number of times they want; need a downvote function or something similar, so that i can reduce the prevalence of certain types of content in my feed, and more specific topic filters would be great too; in many cases, a nested comment system would make more sense than making every comment its own article, which compels a flurry of taps in order to track back-and-forth bw writers; i'm seeing old, recycled-from-the-web articles in my feed, when what i (and, i think, news consumers in general) want is the newest, most relevant content; and there are some bugs in the ui.",INTERFACE

"the medium app is fantastic. the crew does a great job of making it worth your while to have the app rather than just using the website on your phone. the layout for each site is optimized, and the ability to create and view custom ""series"" (only viewable in the app) is really a treat.  with a medium account, you enter a community that is part social media, part blogging. think of this as what facebook's notes were 10 years ago (and have failed to become today), with custom features and a much, much better design and user interface.  medium is minimalist, but simply gorgeous. i have multiple blog pages with them, each with its own style, yet incredibly user-friendly.   the only downside to the app is that certain blocks in articles cannot be rendered or customized. i don't downgrade a star for this, as it is industry standard with pretty much any app by a blogging platform.",INTERFACE
all the same hate trump,USER_EXPERIENCE

sorry to say but the latest version is very disappointing. it's really difficult to browse and find new things to read which was the whole point of medium to me.   they also have random subscriber only content scattered in between everything so you have to constantly check and see whether that article that looks interesting is free to read or not. and then stuff you bookmarked is all at the bottom of the page. it makes no sense and judging from the reviews others feel the same. if there's not a better update soon i think i'll be deleting this app.,INTERFACE

"so i need to give you contact access, need to create an account before being able to use it, but i still can't search for stories/people i wish to read/follow!? and why can't i open links in my default browser?  poorly designed app. it is more efficient to just browse medium via chrome.",INTERFACE

useful and bugfree app,USER_EXPERIENCE
well curated and informative articles with minimalistic design.,CONTENT
"a continuous source of frustration, if you're reading something make sure you finish it because if another app gets the focus when you go back to medium app 8 out of 10 times the story you were reading is gone, the app having reset to the home screen.   if you click any notifications from medium, the story you were reading is gone, if you browse away to links in articles, or you drag on images, the story you were reading is gone, if the app is killed by android because of limited resources, the story you were reading is gone. if the story you were reading this s gone good luck trying to find it again. if all fairness flipboard has similar issues, but come on, how hard is it to keep track what the user is reading and place that in a history list the user can use to get back to what he previously read ??",INTERFACE

awesome,USER_EXPERIENCE
it would be great if it supported domain fronting to circumvent blocks by certain countries,INTERFACE
"it asks for contacts, if you login via google.  login externally, and no permissions required.  still. a bad idea. to have it access contacts. why do you need to?   stories are good. but lack credibility. since they're not reporters, there's no way to cross check and confirm them.  the app itself is very heavy. consumers a sufficient amount of data and is very slow.  people need fast apps to read stories. and not everyone wants to read all the of story. starting with a good gist will be a better idea.",INTERFACE
"this app is pretty awesome.  i'm not bored by the stories,  and they seem relevant to my life.  i wanted to download this app for quite some time,  but did not have enough space in my old phone.  the minute i saw this app on the big bad web though,  i immediately downloaded it onto my new phone.  really liked it.  :)",USER_EXPERIENCE

let's you read without destructions.,INTERFACE
the one thing i would love would be offline reading.,USER_EXPERIENCE
"it's very troublesome. i am an one plus two user and even after the app update, i am unable to login. please please fix this.",INTERFACE
cool app,USER_EXPERIENCE
"love it. the only problem i have with medium - i cannot find my bookmarks! there's simply no path to them through the menu or dashboard. but this feature is missing in the browser version as well. and apart from that, the app is great, sometimes i even write my articles in it on the phone.",INTERFACE
"i love this app but everytime i try to view the home screen and the new collections, it just keeps crashing on my. i am on a galaxy note 4.",INTERFACE
superb content,CONTENT
the copy paste feature for publishing doesn't seem to work for me.,INTERFACE

i couldn't stop reading all the articles after a few minutes of downloading,CONTENT
"overall, if you're writing on medium it's essential. if you're not use the mobile site.",USER_EXPERIENCE
a really good app but it needs offline mode like pocket so you could download reads and enjoy when underground during commute.,INTERFACE
"images don't load often.. would be great to have a ""view in web browser"" option",INTERFACE
i have been spending a lot of time writing and reading on medium as i travel for work. best app to learn from reading other's writings and writing my own stuff.,CONTENT

... while sticking with the simplicity of design that always made it great. so much to read and follow and discover.,USER_EXPERIENCE
simple but beautiful design.,INTERFACE
"my first and most significant dislike about this app is the fact that my feed is bombarded with streams of racism. the only way to filter content is to block individual users, rather than block tags or keywords. half of the articles in my feed are tagged, ""white privilege."" i don't want to read that, and the app won't allow me to cater my content based on my interests. i am literally at the mercy of the app, which fed me little more than racist rants. no, thank you. it could have been great, but...",INTERFACE
content quality and the natural recommendation system makes it the best place to be!,USER_EXPERIENCE
"good application, worthy using my data on.",USER_EXPERIENCE
"medium itself as a service is great. but i don't think this is a great app to accompany the awesome service. this app doesn't work well with offline editing. it has to download the drafts every time i try to access them. i can't even read the stories i've visited once i go offline. why make an app when all it does is act like a web browser? seriously, work on better experience, guys. you already have a great service, put some heart into the mobile app!",INTERFACE
i would like the ability to save articles so i could read them offline.,INTERFACE
excellent articles by people having something meaningful to say and a great app overall.,CONTENT

i have put my finger on it yet but there's something about medium that allows some good content to be produced. it's most likely the distraction free environment - something we're not use to as regular web users. i only follow a few feeds and i feel that's enough.,USER_EXPERIENCE
"i'm always read medium articles in train, so it will be good if medium app can know where i read until, so that i can continue later on, just like pocket feature :)",INTERFACE

"i love this... same experience as the website, works perfectly on my tablet.",INTERFACE
it's extremely well designed.  so rare to find that,USER_EXPERIENCE
the app is cool. but it takes a hell lot of time to open the app itself.,INTERFACE
very smooth app and content is very good,CONTENT
useful.,USER_EXPERIENCE
"i love medium the website itself, and this android app does just about everything regularly do on it. it's layout is reminiscent of google android apps with the create new function at the bottom right of the screen. clear layout, as to be expected what makes the desktop site so read able. pop out menus on the top and bottom add options, but otherwise stay hidden affording the reader great screen real estate to read. overall, excellent. :)",INTERFACE

medium is a great unique app for readers and writers alike.,USER_EXPERIENCE
can't do without it.,USER_EXPERIENCE
"like the fact that, there are not too many different fonts and textual effects to juggle with. i like its simplicity. again, comments become posts, so there is no segregation and that personifies simplicity too. some things i don't like: 1) have to deal with serif fonts, 2) no direct video upload, 3) seemless importing of blogs with previously published date and time not possible",INTERFACE
app is wonderful. so clean and simple. my only beef is with the recommendations that it serves. i usually dismiss them totally.,INTERFACE

"basically even better than “good enough but can be better”, but still not absolutely perfect. example: for its basic social-signalling and content-reading functions the app just works. but for medium as a service well, it's article recommendation system makes users believe that almost all long-form writers on the net are either silicon valley entrepeneurs or los angeles-based self-help gurus. and that medium wants you (the users) to all practically read the same handful of articles. content discovery sucks.",CONTENT

really a nice app with lot good content..,CONTENT
"the articles are interesting but the app is sluggish when loading them. seriously, a 5 second wait on the initial picture before i can start scrolling down? and try to read some of the longer comment responses with dots at the end of them to indicate they continue. once you click on them, finish reading and hit the back button, there's a 2-3 second pause each time. ever heard of caching? anyway, it gets really tedious really quick, so much so that i'm considering dumping the app.",INTERFACE
"social media in general has (in my opinion) changed how we interact as people. it has become a ""goto"" place for everything social. medium has slowly started to do that for me for ""unsocial"" things. idea scraping, educational procrastination, even an insomnia aid from time to time. the app works amazingly on my nexus 5x, and lets me do everything i need to. i've yet to author anything through the app, but intend to start using it to edit things i intend to write, when they're written.",INTERFACE

i generally stick with mobile sites rather than slow down my devices with apps. but i gave this a try. glad i did. suddenly able to readily surf more content than i did before. good!  not so good? images authors insert in their stories i can't embiggen or pop out. generally very critical to the story images are added. i can't see them. yeah i need glasses and the ability to zoom.,INTERFACE
good app,USER_EXPERIENCE
would be better still of i could view a history of this stories i had 'liked' previously,INTERFACE

the app asks for contacts access permission on login on android 6.0 and you can not deny access if you want to proceed. the medium app should not be ask for contacts until an action to add contacts or other social experience is initiated by the user. the ask upon login is a very poor minimal information access design. permissions should be asked in the context of their need and related action. don't block your potential reader with out of context permission requests.,INTERFACE
i love medium,USER_EXPERIENCE
the only drawback is that we cannot share drafts,INTERFACE

great app !,USER_EXPERIENCE
"i love reading content on medium and the quality of the content is fantastic - it's engaging, thought provoking and well written. i particularly enjoy discovering new writers and their perspectives on the topics that i love.  unfortunately, the app can't/ doesn't show me the content that i love because it regularly loses or deletes the tags that i follow. each time i select tags to follow, close the app and then open it at a different time and then touch the tags item on the slide out menu i get a message that says ""you aren't following any tags yet.""  i have re-entered my tags time and time again and still the app doesn't save them..  likely because of this my home feed will show the same stories without anything new for days. plus, the same stories are listed multiple times in my home feed which makes it even harder to discover new content.  if these issues would be resolved, i'd rate medium *****. as it is, i struggled to give the app **.",INTERFACE
learnt?,SUBSCRIPTION
everything stinks of quality.,USER_EXPERIENCE
love reading on medium and interacting is very clean.,USER_EXPERIENCE
the medium website allows you to read articles but requires linking a social account for comments. that's fair and i understand that many sites use this sort of third party auth. but i'm not signing up for fb/twitter just to read on a mobile app. works fine in browser so that's where i'll continue to read medium.,INTERFACE
scrolling performance has taken a big hit.,USER_EXPERIENCE

the new logo is a bit of an overkill. otherwise awesome stuff,USER_EXPERIENCE
"minus 1 star because i don't like the new logo: it almost feels dangerous, like i might cut myself if i touch it, it's too geometric, too light and not really that iconic, to me it doesn't match the product... i much preferred the style of the old one, i found it more memorable, more meaningful somehow and definitely not dangerous.",USER_EXPERIENCE
it would be really awesome if you guys add last month top stories button so user can dig deeper.,INTERFACE

the people who have curious minds and who like to read should definitely try this app out! its really good!,CONTENT
love the community,USER_EXPERIENCE
"i regret that i don't take time to explore medium, however i often get notifications about topics that interest me. from technology to sociology to economics and science, the articles are usually well written from a personal point of view. the occasional clunker makes me chuckle too, it's an open community and some writers are better than others :)",CONTENT
i love the idea that i canbread a carefully thought out oped-quality piece on my own terms. it is a pleasure to have my ideas challenged in a thoughtful uncurated manner.,CONTENT
not missing medium anymore,USER_EXPERIENCE
"i have uninstalled it. the old application was very simple, intuitive and i used to love it. however with the new changes it has become impossible for me to use without straining. thanks for the times",INTERFACE

"i started just by reading the articles on medium, and after subscribing, kept getting the mail each day, advertising the latest, and greatest articles. it's the quality of the content that gets my vote, as the app itself simply does what it's supposed to: deliver the content, and get out of the way. i guess i like it for that reason.",INTERFACE
"nice presentation, mostly interesting content suggestions.",CONTENT

medium has that new neat feel with awesome people to connect with.,USER_EXPERIENCE
i love the medium platform. it's an amazingly sleek way of following bloggers and short-term authors. its simplistic interface and comfortably-read fonts make reading in the app or on the site a good experience.,INTERFACE
"on my tablet, a lenovo a3000 with android, on the medium app text looks ugly. slightly blurry, too thin. made worse by the fact that the app doesn't provide any settings to tweak appearance in any way. (low light, dark background mode would be useful for peoplw who read too). strange enough, smaler text renderwd on the home screen looks just fine.",INTERFACE
"enough nagging and popups forcing me to install the app. weirdly enough, the web app is still better in terms of scrolling performance especially when gifs come into play. but it's still a decent app for reading stuff.",INTERFACE
"i can't even see a list of my stories but only drafts, therefore i can safely deem this app useless. i am better off going to the website itself.",INTERFACE
"really good, i have medium on my laptop , and the only problem was that if your a stupid person .. like me., you will accidentally delete your drafts... so just be careful if you have medium on a different form of technology.",INTERFACE

"would've loved to give it a 5 star, but the absence of image zooming is a big minus for my reading experience",INTERFACE
"i often go offline with my phone, as i don't have data. i like to pre-open some articles at home to read them offline, but after leaving home, they won't stay in memory and i have nothing to read. even google chrome does better job here, it keeps it's open pages in the cache to access offline. please update the otherwise excellent app to support offline reading, to pre-cache articles.",INTERFACE
the interface keeps repeating the same stories as if it's stuck in some loop. all i can see is a couple of stories (5 to 6) and that's it. they keep on repeating.,INTERFACE
installed the app and deleted it within 2 mins. it is just a blogger and shouldn't really force people to have an account. how come i can read medium posts on the web without the account and can't do the same using the app. trying too hard to become a social media app?,INTERFACE
"i like medium but then i only get to read at night, so i hope there'll be a night mode feature available soon. customizable text layout would be also nice!",INTERFACE

the interface is nice and comfortable. but the main value of medium is it's writers,INTERFACE

the app is very nice.  the concept is appealing.  the actual content seems a bit narrowly focused.  two thumbs up for adding landscape support!,INTERFACE

fascinating and informative.,CONTENT
loving it,USER_EXPERIENCE
"i hadn't so much as even heard of medium until i was linked to it via the potus and his use of it to introduce the trans pacific partnership document. having used the medium platform to explore the trade rep's offerings on the tpp, i found myself poking around for other topics to read, mostly just to keep using medium. i'm not sure what better recommendation i could offer than to sum it up this way: i like the medium platform so much that i was reading government documents joyfully.",CONTENT
"only open the side ones, then always after the email something wrong the website say, i uninstall this garbage",INTERFACE
"when i originally looked at medium, i approached it as a news source. it quickly became a place i found perspective, and is one of my ""must read"" regulars. read it. you'll thank me.",CONTENT

i like medium because it has many great articles from many peoples. just like a collection of many blogs.,CONTENT
"i like the idea of the app, but the writing experience is worse than other app. i try to a copy a story in draft, but it only copy one paragraph not all of the paragraph. it's often loading again with green background, when i leave it for a while to the other app. i mean, what wrong's with this app! a few minutes ago, when i copied a story from the other app and publish it. when i saw it, there wasn't any space there!(except the last paragraph that i make in this app). please fix it! or 2 star!",INTERFACE

"i do get it, i love the reading time estimates and the format on a hand-held...but the content is virtual reality banter firmly grounded in the us version of capitalism. it is the kind of thinking that gives us the monotonous sameness of malls and fast-food franchises that suck the life out of locations. i look forward to a wider spectrum of philosophies, cultural perspectives.",CONTENT

i love it! took me a while to move from the web version but now i'd rather the app.,INTERFACE
the news feed is awesome! it shows exactly what i want to read. it has from the start. however i would like to see some more data management options in the settings. such as pre downloading images and stories while on wifi. since much of my free reading time is during times of no internet it makes sense to pre cache stuff. the only reason i gave 4 stars is because of this.,INTERFACE
"don't get me wrong, medium is an awesome site. but the app is so frustrating. i don't care about medium recommend stuffs, i just want the articles for the tags i followed, but there are no option to disable that, that's why i ignore the home completely. and then, even with the tag, i can only scroll for 10 latest articles and useless comments or so. it's just such a buzz kill.",INTERFACE

why'd it take so long?,INTERFACE
"okish, but the web-based interface is better  this new client looks fancier overall and i really welcome a native app over the previous ""add to home screen"" from chrome option.  however, it seems as if the app does not support landscape mode. i have a nexus 9 that i always use with a keyboard, so this is a ""bit"" annoying.  also, the composer in the app is suboptimal. you can pretty much use the composer in the web-based version on a tablet without issues and i have been doing that to write pretty long articles. the composer in the android app is extremely limited, so i do not see myself typing anything in it :-/",INTERFACE

medium for android is excellent addition to my intelligently social go-to apps - its ui and crossover to other platforms shows developers understand its customer base - not as feature-packed as medium on the web but it is an awesome start,CONTENT

should be able to read content without creating an account/linking to another account.,INTERFACE
"not sure why it's broken in app and not in browser when opening link via email. texts look small and have weird line height, images pixelated. what the hell happened?",INTERFACE
"why is it you cannot access your own drafts in the app? you can start a new story, but you can't access drafts. incredibly stupid. gave two stars because as a reading app it's pretty decent, but for everything else it's just garbage. you can't see who you follow or who's following you, you can't see your stats, you can't edit your profile... that's a big list of problems already! medium, please get it sorted, you're better than this.",INTERFACE

"i've become generally disgusted with social media, and so i've turned to news apps like flipboard or google play news. i think it's amazing that this app seems to combine the concept of social networking into the news infrastructure, so i can share my thoughts with the world while actually learning something. the problem i face now, though, is that it keeps crashing on the nexus 6. it should be noted that i'm using the android m beta, so that could be it, but the app is nearly unusable because it crashes.",INTERFACE
"if you are offline, the app is unusable. which makes it seem like nothing more than a web view. also, drafts that i started on the web are not available on the app. however, if you are online and are simply consuming content, the app works perfectly... but so does the website.",INTERFACE
had it since beta and so far i have nothing to complain about,USER_EXPERIENCE
was waiting for this app for last 6 months. and love the continuity in design from web to app. just feels so right,USER_EXPERIENCE
"overall, the app is well designed and maintains the simplicity of the desktop version. i would, however like the following features: 1. ability to edit ones profile  2. ability to discard a draft. right now one has to manually delete the full content  3. option to add multiple drafts. not sure if this is already there, but couldn't find it.",INTERFACE

"sehr gute app, von der ich überzeugter nutzer bin. allerdings finde ich das es ein großes minus gibt, da man seine entwürfe nicht offline schreiben kann...ich bin gerade auf weltreise und liebe es über die platform meine erlebnisse mit anderen zu teilen, leider ist häufig das internet schlecht und medium braucht viel davon, besonders beim bilder einfügen. gerade wenn ich irgendwo am starnd liege und mir denke jetzt einen artikel schreiben wäre super geht das leider schlecht ohne internet.",USER_EXPERIENCE
